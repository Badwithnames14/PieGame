# PieGame
A game about making pie. It's not great, but just mainly for me to learn more about making 2D games 

PyGame is required to run this game, and it is currently not finished. Apple Pie is the test case for most functions and should 
be the first type completed.

There is some code from StackOverflow, I believe I cited what I took and hope it's clear
